# Real-Time Hand Detection using Haar Cascade Classifier

This project implements a **Real-Time Hand Detection System** using **Haar Cascade Classifier** and **OpenCV**. The system detects hands in video streams, providing a foundation for gesture recognition, hand tracking, and other interactive applications.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection using Haar-like features and Haar Cascade Classifiers.
- Efficient use of OpenCV libraries to capture and process live video streams.
- Customizable detection settings such as scaling and sensitivity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **OpenCV**: Open-source computer vision library for real-time image and video processing.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Pre-trained model based on Haar-like features for object detection.
