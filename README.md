Real-Time Hand Detection using OpenCV and Python

This project focuses on real-time hand detection using OpenCV and Python.
It processes live video streams to detect hands using techniques like contour detection and thresholding. 
The implementation is designed for simple hand detection without gesture recognition or additional features. 
It provides an efficient and straightforward approach to identifying hands in video feed.
